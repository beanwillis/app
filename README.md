# Welcome to Vi's personal website
This is my personal playground to showcase what I self-learn on Youtube.

My goal is to improve my skill in Front-end development, but in the future, I plan to implement some other features in this personal portfolio website as well (eg. blog post using markdown editor), then I would need to host a database (maybe MongoDb).

I'm learning day by day. Let's see my progress overtime!
